.. slide-3d::
    :id: bored
    :class: step slide
    :x: -1000
    :y: -1500

    Aren't you just *bored* with all those slides-based presentations?


.. slide-3d::
    :class: step slide
    :x: 0
    :y: -1500

    Don't you think that presentations given in modern browsers shouldn't
    copy the limits of 'classic' slide decks?


.. slide-3d::
    :class: step slide
    :x: 1000
    :y: -1500

    Would you like to **impress** your audience with 
    stunning visualization of your talk?


.. slide-3d::
    :id: title
    :class: step
    :x: 0
    :y: 0
    :scale: 4

    then you should try impress.js

.. slide-3d::
    :id: its
    :class: step
    :x: 850
    :y: 3000
    :rotate: 90
    :scale: 5

    It's a presentation tool 
    inspired by the idea behind prezi.com
    and based on the power of CSS3 transforms and transitions in modern browsers.


.. slide-3d::
    :id: big
    :class: step
    :x: 3500
    :y: 2100
    :rotate: 180
    :scale: 6

    visualize your big thoughts

.. slide-3d::
    :id: tiny
    :class: step
    :x: 2825
    :y: 2325
    :z: -3000
    :rotate: 300
    :scale: 1

    and tiny ideas

.. slide-3d::
    :id: ing
    :class: step
    :x: 3500
    :y: -850
    :rotate: 270
    :scale: 6

    by positioning, rotating and scaling them on an infinite canvas


.. slide-3d::
    :id: imagination
    :class: step
    :x: 6700
    :y: -300
    :scale: 6

    the only limit is your imagination

.. slide-3d::
    :id: source
    :class: step
    :x: 6300
    :y: 2000
    :rotate: 20
    :scale: 4

    want to know more? use the source, Luke!

.. slide-3d::
    :id: one-more-thing
    :class: step
    :x: 6000
    :y: 4000
    :scale: 2

    one more thing...

.. slide-3d::
    :id: its-in-3d
    :class: step
    :x: 6200
    :y: 4300
    :z: -100
    :rotate-x: -40
    :rotate-y: 10
    :scale: 2

    have you noticed it's in 3D?
